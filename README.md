# Academic Context

This project was developed within the framework of the Control and Automation for the Efficient Use of Energy (CAPUEE) course, coursed at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) as part of the Master’s Degree in Energy Engineering. The course focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of automation systems aimed at improving energy efficiency.

Throughout the course, we acquired skills in rapid prototyping, data communication, visualization and API integration, and the development of innovative solutions that combine hardware and software to optimize energy use.
